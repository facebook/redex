# ReDex: An Android Bytecode Optimizer

ReDex is an Android bytecode (dex) optimizer originally developed at
Facebook. It provides a framework for reading, writing, and analyzing .dex
files, and a set of optimization passes that use this framework to improve the
bytecode.  An APK optimized by ReDex should be smaller and faster than its
source.
