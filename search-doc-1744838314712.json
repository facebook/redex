Running the app gives the following output on the display of the device:    You can instruct Redex to prevent a class or interface from begin deleted by providing a ProGuard rule.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"A Simple Example","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/getting_started/configuring/","content":"ReDex can be configured to run different optimizations or to alter the behavior of existing optimizations. While this isn't always necessary, it's helpful to be able to tweak settings to get the best results. A Simple Example A starting point for configuration is to use a configuration similar to the default config that's baked in to the redex binary. You can find this config in config/default.config. This is what it looks like: { &quot;redex&quot; : { &quot;passes&quot; : [ &quot;ReBindRefsPass&quot;, &quot;BridgeSynthInlinePass&quot;, &quot;FinalInlinePassV2&quot;, &quot;DelSuperPass&quot;, &quot;SingleImplPass&quot;, &quot;MethodInlinePass&quot;, &quot;StaticReloPassV2&quot;, &quot;RemoveUnreachablePass&quot;, &quot;ShortenSrcStringsPass&quot;, &quot;RegAllocPass&quot; ] } } Name this file default.config, and invoke redex with it: % redex.py -c default.config -o tmp/output.apk input.apk This will do... exactly what redex does without the config. Not so exciting, is it? Let's move on to something more advanced. Selecting Optimization Passes Changing the set of optimizations ReDex runs is easy; just add (or remove) the pass name from the redex.passes list. For example, let's say you want to remove the ShortenSrcStrings optimization while you're debugging something. Just use this config: { &quot;redex&quot; : { &quot;passes&quot; : [ &quot;ReBindRefsPass&quot;, &quot;BridgeSynthInlinePass&quot;, &quot;FinalInlinePassV2&quot;, &quot;DelSuperPass&quot;, &quot;SingleImplPass&quot;, &quot;MethodInlinePass&quot;, &quot;RemoveUnreachablePass&quot;, &quot;RegAllocPass&quot; ] } } Configuring optimization behavior Each optimization pass has some configurable parameters that are specific to that pass. These are often blocklists (or allowlists) indicating what code the optimization should leave alone (for blocklists) or what code should be optimized (for allowlists). A simple example is ShortenSrcStrings. This pass removes filenames indicating what source code produced each class. It's a waste to ship those source strings to production, but it's useful to be able to map the shortened names back to the original names (e.g., for solving user bug reports). You can tell ShortenSrcStrings to produce this map by adding a config entry: &quot;redex&quot; : { &quot;passes&quot; : [ ShortenSrcStringsPass, &quot;RegAllocPass&quot; ] }, &quot;ShortenSrcStringsPass&quot; : { &quot;filename_mappings&quot; : &quot;/tmp/filename_mappings.txt&quot; } Options for each pass are documented with that pass. Global options redex.passesType: array of strings A list of passes to be run in the specified order. coldstart_classesType: string Path to a file containing a list of class names in the order they are used for cold start. Example format: com/foo/Bar.class com/foo/Baz.class ... com/foo/Quux.class proguard_mapType: string Path to a file containing ProGuard's mapping of unobfuscated class/field/method names to obfuscated names. This option is useful if you are running ReDex after ProGuard, so that ReDex will properly understand obfuscated names. Complete configuration To see the (almost) complete list of configuration parameters, run redex-all --reflect-config (Note that you run redex-all here, not the redex.py wrapper!) This emits a JSON document detailing parameters, their types, defaults and possibly documentation.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Redex Synth Pass Example","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/examples/synth/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Removing synthetic methods for accessing static fields​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Redex Synth Pass Example","url":"/docs/examples/synth/#removing-synthetic-methods-for-accessing-static-fields","content":" This directory contains an Android Studio 1.5 project that illustrates how a wrapper synthetic method is removed by Redex. The contrived example is a simple Android application which makes use of this class:  package com.facebook.redex.examples.synth; public class Alpha { private static int alpha; public Alpha(int initialValue) { alpha = initialValue; } public class Beta { public int doubleAlpha() { return 2 * alpha; } } }   The key thing to note here is that there is an inner class Beta which has a method doubleAlpha which accesses a private static field alpha of its outer class Alpha. A dump of the Dex bytecode for the Alpha class confirms that the alpha field is private and static.   Static fields - #0 : (in Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;) name : 'alpha' type : 'I' access : 0x000a (PRIVATE STATIC)   Java compilers will implement accesses] to this field from inner classes by generating a synthetic getter method to allow the inner class to access the private field of the outer class. We can see the automatically generated synthetic method access$000if we examine the Dex bytecode for the Alpha class:  Class #597 - Class descriptor : 'Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;' ... #1 : (in Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;) name : 'access$000' type : '()I' access : 0x1008 (STATIC SYNTHETIC) code - registers : 1 ins : 0 outs : 0 insns size : 3 16-bit code units 065f14: |[065f14] com.facebook.redex.examples.synth.Alpha.access$000:()I 065f24: 6000 070b |0000: sget v0, Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;.alpha:I // field@0b07 065f28: 0f00 |0002: return v0   This generated synthetic method can be accessed by the inner class which keeps the JVM happy. All it does is to read the state field value using an sget instruction and return the read value. This synthetic wrapper is used in the implementation of doubleAlpha:   Virtual methods - #0 : (in Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha$Beta;) name : 'doubleAlpha' ... 065ed8: |[065ed8] com.facebook.redex.examples.synth.Alpha.Beta.doubleAlpha:()I 065ee8: 7100 1118 0000 |0000: invoke-static {}, Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;.access$000:()I // method@1811 065eee: 0a00 |0003: move-result v0 065ef0: da00 0002 |0004: mul-int/lit8 v0, v0, #int 2 // #02 065ef4: 0f00 |0006: return v0   For the doubleAlpha method in the inner class Beta to access the private static field of the enclosing class an invoke-static call is made to the synthetic wrapper method access$000.  Here is an example of the doubleAlpha method being used from a simple Android application:  package com.facebook.redex.examples.synth; import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity; import android.os.Bundle; import android.widget.TextView; public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.message); textView.setText(&quot;Redex Synth Example\\n&quot;); Alpha a = new Alpha(12); Alpha.Beta b = a.new Beta(); textView.append(&quot;Double Alpha(12) = &quot; + b.doubleAlpha() + &quot;\\n&quot;); } }   If we examined the Dex bytecode for the call to doubleAlpha we would see something like this which shows a virtual call to the doubleAlpha method:   Direct methods - #0 : (in Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/MainActivity;) name : 'onCreate' ... 065fb6: 6e10 0f18 0100 |0031: invoke-virtual {v1}, Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha$Beta;.doubleAlpha:()I // method@180f ...   After running Redex the synthetic wrapper method will be removed and the code for accessing the alpha static field will be inlined into the code for the main activity:   Direct methods - #0 : (in Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/MainActivity;) name : 'onCreate' ... 07f246: 6005 4d06 |0031: sget v5, Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;.alpha:I // field@064d 07f24a: da05 0502 |0033: mul-int/lit8 v5, v5, #int 2 // #02 ...   To make the access of the alpha field legal for the Dalvik VM we have mutated the access permissions for this field:   Static fields - #0 : (in Lcom/facebook/redex/examples/synth/Alpha;) name : 'alpha' type : 'I' access : 0x0009 (PUBLIC STATIC)   Similar optimizations exist for other synthetic wrapper scenarios e.g. for instance fields.

The removal of the interfaces simplifies the type system and enables additional type system level optimizations.  We remove each interface by replacing each invoke-interface site with a generated dispatch stub that models the interface call semantic at bytecode level. After that we remove the existing references to them from the implementors and remove them completely. We start at the leaf level of the interface hierarchy. After removing the leaf level, we iteratively apply the same transformation to the now newly formed leaf level again and again until all interfaces are removed.  Note that this is a critical pass for optimizing GraphQL generated fragment models. Aside from the fragment model classes themselves, the GraphQL tool chain also generates a Java interface for each GraphQL fragment namely fragment interface. The existence of these interfaces greatly complicates the type system of the generated GraphQL fragment models making merging the underlying model classes virtually impossible.

The app's config file can direct StripDebugInfoPass removals at a more granular level:  &quot;StripDebugInfoPass&quot; : { &quot;drop_all_dbg_info&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;drop_local_variables&quot; : &quot;1&quot;, &quot;drop_line_numbers&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;drop_src_files&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;use_allowlist&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;cls_allowlist&quot; : [], &quot;method_allowlist&quot; : [], &quot;drop_prologue_end&quot; : &quot;1&quot;, &quot;drop_epilogue_begin&quot; : &quot;1&quot;, &quot;drop_all_dbg_info_if_empty&quot; : &quot;1&quot;, &quot;drop_synth_aggressive&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;drop_line_numbers_preceeding_safe&quot; : &quot;1&quot; },   Pass ordering dependencies:  StripDebugInfoPass should be run early as removal of the debug info should make other passes faster.Inlining complicates the flow graph for debug info. StripDebugInfoPassshould be run before any inlining passes, and will not optiimize if inlining has been performed.
