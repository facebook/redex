# XXX(jezng): I tried running these commands as part of the Buck build, but I'm
# having trouble getting the Buck-given versions of AAPT and the SDK libraries
# to work together -- in particular, running the AAPT from v23 against the SDK
# from v26 causes AAPT to crash. Rather than spending time figuring out how to
# get Buck to use the versions I want, I'm just going to run the command
# locally and commit the result...
