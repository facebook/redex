## Optimizations

This is a relatively small incremental release bringing two new optimizations:

- A new resource inlining pass, inlining universally constant resources values directly in the code, eliminating expensive resource lookups. This first implementation only considers colors, ints and bools, but does not yet consider strings.
- Eliminating unused arguments in true virtual methods. This reduces method invocation overhead for virtual methods.

## Other improvements

- Support for `-assumevalues` in ProGuard specifications, as supported by R8. This unlocks additional optimizations in Redex.
