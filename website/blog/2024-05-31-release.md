## Optimizations

This release bundles a few improved optimizations that improve code size and performance:

- Improvements to object escape analysis and associated transformations (support for check-casts, returning parameters, true virtual and super invocations, comparing objects with null, and a whole new global cost function), resulting in fewer object allocations and more inlining.
- Streamlined treatment of system annotations (a conceptual cleanup effort that lead to a size reduction).
- Value numbering for branch conditions eliminating branches in code.

## Build Speed / Reliability / Better Engineering

- Improved precision of analysis for class references from layouts and XML attributes, preventing Redex from removing referenced classes.
- First steps towards addressing an ancient design bug in Redex causing improper handling of the `package-private` access modifier.
- Performance improvements to Redex infrastructure.
