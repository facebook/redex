This release brings enhancements to existing optimizations:

- `BranchPrefixHoisting` runs more often, hoisting more instructions.
- Improvements to inlining, inlining almost 1% more callsites while reducing code-size overall.
- Improvements to source blocks for merged classes.
- New pass `InsertDebugInfoPass` to insert artificial debug info for incoming code that is missing line numbers.
- Improvements to .pro parsing logic and dex loading logic (not expected to change application perf).
- Improvements to constant propagation analyzers to evaluate package names.
