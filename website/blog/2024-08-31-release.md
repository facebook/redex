## Optimizations

This release bundles a few improved optimizations that improve code size and performance:

- Relax init optimization that inlines the constructor calls at object instantiation site. As a result, we can also remove the constructor method from the class.
- By reordering classes in `InterdexPass`, we made dexes more dense after Halfnosis pass and empty dexes will be left behind and can be removed by the newly introduced `DexRemovalPass`.

## Better Engineering & Reliability Improvements

- Improved dead resource elimination, to bring parity between `.apk` and `.aab` builds for removed resources.
- Classes using the `ServiceLoader` Java APIs will now be kept by Redex; keep rules are no longer necessary.
- Class renaming improvements to better identify class names used by layout files and string references.
- Improved annotation handling in `SingleImplPass`.
