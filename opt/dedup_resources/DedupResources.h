/**
 * Finds resource identifiers whose metadata values are identical in all
 * configurations. Of a set of duplicates, the smallest resource identifier will
 * be considered the "canonical" version and all others will have their data
 * removed. Resource IDs throughout the application (whether it be dex code,
 * binary XML files, and resource table references) are then rewritten to refer
 * to the canonical and resource identifiers are compacted to save more space in
 * resources.arsc file.
 *
 * In order to increase the amount of duplicate rows in the resource table, file
 * paths are checked for equality too.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * As with other Android Resource optimizations, rewriting dex code to reflect
 * modified resource identifiers relies on changing static field values of the
 * associated R classes, so these values must NOT be inlined throughout the
 * program (either by Redex passes or by compiler options before Redex)!
 *
 * Config options:
 * If a resource cannot be removed, either individual names (or entire types)
 * can be disabled. Do this if there is any requirement on looking up resources
 * by their string name, i.e. android.content.res.Resources.getIdentifier() on a
 * non-canonical duplicate. Also note that this pass has not been equally tested
 * against all possible resource types. "attr" type has some known problems with
 * regards to xml attribute ordering in app bundles, so for best results enable
 * this for simple things like dimen, color, etc.
 *
 * Possible further improvements:
 * This does not do a particularly good job of finding duplicate files when run
 * against .aab inputs. Reason for this is that .pb schema for .xml files will
 * encode some trivial details, ostensibly for human readability that will not
 * matter for emitting the final .apk format of xml files. This makes our naive
 * hashing/file equivalence is not good enough to recognize true duplicates.
 * This unfortunately means that the output of this pass can be different when
 * run against equivalent .apk / .aab files. Ideally the pass would do the same
 * thing, but oh well not yet.
