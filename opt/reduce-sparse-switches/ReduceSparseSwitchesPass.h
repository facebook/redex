This pass reduces sparse switch instructions.

Sparse switches are expensive at runtime when they get compiled by ART, as
they get translated to a linear sequence of conditional branches which take
O(N) time to execute, where N is the number of switch cases.

This pass performs two transformations which are designed to improve
runtime performance:

1. Splitting sparse switches into packed segments and remaining sparse
   switches. We only do this if we can find a partitioning of a sparse
   switch of size N into M packed segments and a remaining sparse switch
   of size L such that
       M + log2(L) <= log2(N).
   This transformation is largely size neutral.
   Before the transformation, the interpreter would have O(log2(N)) and
   compiled code O(N). After the tranformation, the interpreter gets down
   to O(M + log2(L)) and compiled code to O(M + L). So while the runtime
   performance of the interpreter won't change much, compiled code will run
   must faster; if L gets close to 0, we get O(M) <= O(log2(N)).
2. Multiplexing sparse switches into a main packed switch with secondary sparse
   switches for each main switch case. The basic idea is that we partition a
   large number of sparse switch cases into several buckets of relatively small
   sparse switch cases. The bucket index is basically a hash of the case keys,
   computed with one or two bit-twiddling instructions, and limited to a small
   numeric range, which allows us to perform a packed switch over it. Ideally,
   each bucket holds roughly the same number of switch cases, and we want to
   avoid excessively large outlier buckets.
   This transformation comes with a modest size regression.
   Given a switch with N case keys, we aim at partitioning it into
   M = ~sqrt(N) buckets with ~sqrt(N) case keys in each bucket. (We don't
   achieve that in practice, and there are rounding effects as well.)
   In that case, before the transformation, the interpreter would have O(log2(N))
   and compiled code O(N). After the tranformation, the interpreter gets down
   to O(log2(sqrt(N))) and compiled code to O(sqrt(N)).
   (We could try to partition buckets even further, e.g. down to log2(N), but
   that might result in an excessive size regression.)

Finally, less for runtime performance but rather to avoid size-overhead, we can
expand the remaining small sparse switches to a sequence of if-eq instructions.
