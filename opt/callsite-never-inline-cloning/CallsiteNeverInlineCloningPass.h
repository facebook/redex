A method that is called from both a profiled-hot call site and a
profiled-cold call site cannot be marked `@NeverInline` by
`ArtProfileWriterPass`: doing so would also block ART's AOT inliner at the hot
call site, where inlining is wanted. This pass resolves that conflict ahead of
`InitialRenameClassesPass` and `InterDexPass`, so a later `ArtProfileWriterPass`
sees the result: for such a "mixed-hotness" callee, it clones the method (a
plain, same-class, full copy, via `DexMethod::make_method_from`, so debug info
and the built CFG carry over unchanged) and rewrites only the call sites in a
profiled-cold block to invoke the clone; call sites in a not-proven-cold block
keep calling the original, unchanged -- and so does the call instruction's own
opcode, since the clone keeps the original's exact access flags (virtual or
not, visibility, `final`-ness). The clone is marked `dont_inline` (Redex's own
inliner will not touch it) and its own `SourceBlock` values are zeroed, so it
presents as a method with no observed hot execution of its own -- letting a
subsequent `ArtProfileWriterPass` see a purely-cold callee and attach
`@NeverInline` to it, while the original, now free of any observed-cold
caller, is left for normal treatment.

Only an exact call site is ever redirected: `invoke-static`, `invoke-direct`,
or an `invoke-virtual` resolving to a non-true-virtual method (per Redex's
method-override graph: one that neither overrides nor is overridden by any
other method in the current scope, so its dispatch is exact even though it is
not declared `final`). `invoke-super` and `invoke-interface` call sites are
always left alone; no receiver-type inference is attempted for an otherwise
true-virtual `invoke-virtual`.

The pass also honors Redex's shared transformation constraints. A callee marked
`no_optimizations` or `no_outlining` is never cloned; the latter is the
body-copying gate also used by HotColdMethodSpecializingPass and the outlining
passes. The target class must be renamable, following PartialApplicationPass's
same-class-helper rule: adding a generated method to a kept class can change the
declared-method set visible through reflection. A plain `dont_inline` marker is
not a cloning prohibition -- it only constrains Redex's own inliner. The
configured class-prefix `blocklist` remains available for app-specific cases
that are not represented by these shared semantic flags.

The hot/cold classification of a call site, and the shape-eligibility of a
callee to be cloned away from (does it have a return block, is it within the
configured code-unit/instruction bounds -- `max_callee_code_units` (default
40) sized to the callees ART could plausibly inline anyway, bounding the
clone's own DEX cost, and `min_callee_instructions` (default 4) filtering out
a body too small for cloning to matter -- is it not a trivial forwarder, which
`ArtProfileWriterPass` would otherwise still see straight through to the
original body it wraps), mirror `ArtProfileWriterPass`'s own `never_inline`
analysis for exactly the call sites this pass itself ever resolves (the
`invoke-static`/`invoke-direct`/non-true-virtual set above) -- not that
analysis's full breadth, which also chases a receiver-type map to sometimes
resolve an otherwise-ambiguous `invoke-virtual`, and follows a forwarder
chain to its ultimate callee; this pass deliberately does neither. Within
that narrower set: only call sites inside a
profiled-compiled caller are inspected at all; a caller over
`max_caller_instructions`/`max_caller_registers` is skipped entirely; a call
site whose containing block can throw into a callee that itself has a catch
handler is skipped; an invoke immediately preceding an explicit `throw` at the
end of its block, up to and including the first non-`<init>` one, is treated
as exception-construction noise, not a call site, and is skipped the same way
`ArtProfileWriterPass` skips it. The callee shape-eligibility check itself
(`never_inline_analysis::never_inline_eligibility`, in `libredex/`) is the
exact same function `ArtProfileWriterPass` calls for its own annotation
decision, factored out specifically so the two passes cannot drift apart: a
callee this pass ever clones is, by construction, one a later
`ArtProfileWriterPass` run is willing to annotate -- with one access-flag
exception: `ArtProfileWriterPass`'s own virtual-callee eligibility check is
narrower than this pass's own (`is_final(method) || is_final(class)`, not the
broader non-true-virtual notion above), so a clone of a non-final,
non-true-virtual callee is additionally marked `final`, matching
`PartialApplicationPass`, purely so that later pass is willing to annotate it
too. Clone names follow the same generated-name convention: a reserved `$cnic$`
tag, pass iteration, stable hash of the full callee identity, and deterministic
hash-collision index keep independently generated helpers distinct. This never
changes the clone's virtual-ness, visibility, or which existing callers can
reach it.

A shape-eligible mixed-hotness callee is cloned only if it also clears the
profitability model's thresholds (`min_hot_callsites`, `min_cold_callsites`,
`min_estimated_oat_code_units_saved`, a positive estimated net after a
`method_ref_cost` charge scaled by the number of distinct classes the
redirected cold call sites live in) -- see the `Config` fields' own doc
strings for the exact formula -- and fits within the deterministic, net-ranked
`max_total_clones`/`max_total_cloned_code_units` caps. Every number in that
model is a conservative pre-InterDex estimate for ranking and gating, not a
promised or measured byte count.

This pass produces no clone and rewrites no call site for a callee with only
cold call sites (nothing to split away from), or for any program with no
baseline-profile/`SourceBlock` profiling data at all -- so on a build with no
such instrumentation, this pass is a no-op. With its own bare defaults
(`hot_block_appear_threshold`/`hot_method_appear_threshold` both -1, matching
`ArtProfileWriterPass`'s own global default), it is a no-op for any app that
has not explicitly configured those two thresholds, since it then cannot
distinguish a hot call site from a cold one. Like every Redex pass, it can
also be turned off entirely for an app via `<PassName>.disabled(True)` in that
app's config; it is unconditionally disabled by default in `module_core.refig`.
