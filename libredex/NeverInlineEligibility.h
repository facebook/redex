// the checks that depend on the method's own body and not on any caller
// context. An existing `@NeverInline` annotation, and hot/cold call-site
// classification, remain each caller's own concern. Shared so that a pass
// deciding to annotate a method and a pass deciding to clone one for
// annotation cannot drift apart on what is eligible.

// but its own parameters, at most one constant/field-read/invoke, and a
// return. ART's own inliner absorbs a body this shape regardless of any
// `@NeverInline` annotation, so annotating it -- or cloning it away for that
// purpose -- would be dead weight.
//
// If the body's one interior instruction is an invoke and `invoke_insn` is
// non-null, `*invoke_insn` is set to it -- used by a caller chasing a
// forwarder chain to its real target (a devirtualizing callee resolver).
// `never_inline_eligibility` below does not need this output; it calls with
// the default `nullptr`.
